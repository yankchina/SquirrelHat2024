# Squirrel Hat 

Squirrel Quest is a SwiftUI-based iOS app designed to help users focus on achieving one lifestyle habit at a time, such as walking, reading, or fitness activities. By concentrating on a single goal over a predefined period (e.g., 4 weeks), users can efficiently manage their energy and commitment without feeling overwhelmed by multiple objectives.

## Features

- **Single Habit Tracking**: Focus on one habit at a time to avoid spreading your effort too thin.
- **Customizable Plans**: Set specific goals for your habit, including duration and timeframe.
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily check-ins to record your activity and track your progress over time.
- **Cloud Integration**: Plans and progress are stored in the cloud, ensuring your data is always up-to-date across devices.
- **Plan Adjustment**: Ability to modify your current plan or switch to a new habit after completing the current one.
